The code in this study was developed using the MATLAB R2022a platform, encompassing raw data and computational code for Section 5.1 "Numerical Case Study" and Section 5.2 "Group Decision Framework for EV Battery Brand Selection". 
Among these, the start-up file for Section 5.1 is "Numerical_Case_Study.mlx", and the start-up file for Section 5.2 is "EV_battery_brand_selection.mlx". 
The implementation processes of the code for both sections are fully consistent with those described in the literature, with specific computational details reflected through the formulas in the .mlx files.
